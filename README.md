# coffeeShopAnalysis

## Project Overview

This portfolio project tells the story of a coffee retail business that wants to better understand **what is driving its sales and profits**, and how data can support smarter decisions around products, pricing, and expansion.

The dataset represents historical coffee orders, including product types, roast levels, sizes, customers, countries, sales revenue, and profit. Rather than starting with charts, the project starts with **business questions** and uses visualisations only where they help answer those questions.

---

## Business Context

The business is growing and selling multiple coffee products across regions. Leadership has three core concerns:

* Are we selling *more*, but not necessarily making *more profit*?
* Which coffee products actually drive profitability?
* Are customer preferences consistent across countries, or should offerings differ by market?

To answer these, the business asks the analytics team to turn raw order data into insights they can act on.

## Key Business Questions and Why the Charts Matter

### 1. How are overall sales and profit trending?

**Why the business cares:**
Management wants a high-level health check. If revenue is rising but profit is flat, costs or discounting may be an issue.

**Insight sought:**

* Is the business growing sustainably?
* Are sales and profit moving together?

**Resulting insight:**
Total sales and total profit provide a baseline view of performance and help identify whether growth is healthy or misleading.

---

### 2. Which coffee products generate the most value?

**Why the business cares:**
Not all popular products are profitable. Some may sell well but have low margins.

**Insight sought:**

* Which coffee types contribute most to revenue?
* Which contribute most to profit?

**Resulting insight:**
Comparing sales by coffee type against profit by coffee type reveals which products should be promoted, repriced, or reconsidered.

---

### 3. Does size influence profitability?

**Why the business cares:**
Larger sizes often sell for more, but they also cost more to produce. The business wants to know if upselling actually improves margins.

**Insight sought:**

* Which sizes are most commonly purchased?
* Which sizes deliver the highest profit per order?

**Resulting insight:**
This analysis helps guide pricing strategies and bundle offers, ensuring upsells benefit both customers and the business.

---

### 4. How do roast preferences affect sales and profit?

**Why the business cares:**
Different roasts appeal to different customer segments. Understanding this helps with inventory planning and marketing.

**Insight sought:**

* Which roast levels sell best?
* Are certain roasts more profitable despite lower volume?

**Resulting insight:**
The business can align marketing campaigns and product availability with the most valuable customer preferences.

---

### 5. Where are the strongest markets geographically?

**Why the business cares:**
Expansion and marketing budgets depend on knowing which countries perform best and why.

**Insight sought:**

* Which countries generate the most sales?
* Which generate the most profit?

**Resulting insight:**
Sales and profit by country highlight where demand is strong and where margins may need improvement.

---

### 6. Who are our customers and how do they buy?

**Why the business cares:**
Customer behaviour drives long-term growth. Identifying high-value customers supports retention strategies.

**Insight sought:**

* Do a small number of customers drive a large share of revenue?
* Are there repeat purchasing patterns?

**Resulting insight:**
Customer-level analysis supports loyalty programs, targeted promotions, and personalised marketing.

## Overall Impact

By structuring the analysis around business questions rather than charts alone, this project demonstrates how data analytics supports real decisions:

* Product focus and pricing strategies
* Market expansion planning
* Profit-focused growth instead of revenue-only growth

This approach ensures insights are **actionable**, not just visually appealing.

---

## Tools Used

* Excel (data cleaning and exploration)
* Data modelling across orders, customers, and products
* Business-focused data storytelling

---

*This project emphasises turning data into decisions, not just dashboards.*
