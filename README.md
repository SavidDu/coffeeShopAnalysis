# Coffee Shop Analysis

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to help a new small business understand how it is performing. Having operated for a few years the company would like to know it's general health, where the sales and profits are coming from, which products are doing well, and which geographical location need more attention. The business wants recommendations for which products should be given more focus on and steps it should take to grow.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of three tables; orders, customers, and products.

## Insights Summary

To understand how the business;s needs the following metrics were chosen to explore:

* Overall Growth
* Most Sold Product
* Most Profitable Product
* Largest region by sales and profits

**Overall Growth**
* During the first 2 years of operation the business saw a upwards growth of 13% in sales however in their latest year sales shrank by 49%.
* Initial growth is expected as customer base expands and the business becomes established in the market.
* Sudden decrease in sales can be attributed to the recession brought on by the COVID pandemic.

**Most Sold Product**
* Overall the most sold product is the Arabica bean in Dark roast and size 2.5kg at 6% of all sales.

**Most profitable Product**
* Overall the most profitable product is the Liberca bean in Dark Roast and Size 2.5kg at 7% of all profits.

* This suggests that the core income for the company is repeat customers who have found their preferred product and order in bulk. This also suggests that the smaller sizes do not produce as much sales or profit and are low in popularity.

**Largest region**
* The largest region by far is the United States with 79% of sales and profits.
* Interestingly the United Kingdom has higher profit percentage than sales


## Recommendations

* **Overall growth**: Look into shifting the brand into a more essentials brand in the long term to negate the effects of market swings. Currently the business is vulnerable to market shifts heavily affecting the income.

* **Large Size Products**: Focus on streamlining the large sized products and changing the role of the smaller sized products. The large sized products drive repeat purchasing and bulk ordering, ensure these products are always stocked and potentially look at giving discounts to repeat purchases or even offer a subscription model for predictable income. 

* **Small Size Products**: Turn them into entry products, bundle together as samplers to help bring in more customers into the ecosystem. The small sized products are low in sale volume and profits, turning these into a different role allows for opportunities to bring in more customers.

* **Region**: The core of the customer base is in the United States of America. The product is fairly well established and efforts should be moved to expanding into other regions to reduce reliance on one region. Recommend discussion with the sales team into making tailored promotions into the UK and Ireland utilising the small sized products as samplers.
